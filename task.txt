Deliverables
1. Variable-Length Time Series Clustering Algorithm

Development of a specialized clustering algorithm capable of identifying
similar patterns across financial time series data of arbitrary lengths. The
solution will implement Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with appropriate global
constraints to efficiently handle sequences of vastly different durations while
preserving pattern recognition capabilities. 
2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Creation of a robust preprocessing pipeline that includes:

    Adaptive resampling techniques to handle extreme length variations
    Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) for dimensionality reduction
    Symbolic representation methods for efficient pattern matching
    Z-score normalization to standardize price movements

3. Multi-Scale Pattern Recognition System

Implementation of a multi-scale approach that:

    Stratifies patterns by length for more meaningful comparisons
    Applies appropriate clustering parameters based on time scale
    Identifies representative patterns across different time horizons
    Handles the full spectrum from very short (10 ticks) to very long (2000+ ticks) patterns 

4. Pattern Visualization Tools

Development of specialized visualization tools that:

    Enable time-normalized visualization of variable-length patterns
    Provide multi-panel stratified visualizations by length
    Display cluster representatives and medoids
    Visualize pattern similarity across different time scales

5. Pattern Analysis Framework

Creation of analytical tools to:

    Extract representative patterns (medoids) from each cluster
    Generate barycenter averages for fixed-length representation
    Analyze pattern continuation tendencies for trading insights
    Evaluate pattern distribution across different length strata

6. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

Comprehensive documentation including:

    Technical implementation details
    Algorithm selection rationale
    Parameter optimization guidelines
    Code annotations and usage examples
    Performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations


I want to analyze
- correlation of crash game length to the multiplier.
- optimal entry/exit plan, position size
- scalping opportunities
- risk management
- predicting multiplier from historical data
- backtesting the stragies (good or bad)
- etc ...
